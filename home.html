<h1>All About the New XUV</h1>
<img src="https://digitalsynopsis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/supercar-wallpapers-bugatti-4.jpg" alt="XUV" width="600" height="300">
<p>Mahindra is working on the new generation XUV500 for quite a while now. Though there has been no official word from the Indian SUV maker about the changes on the new model, we have gathered plenty of information, thanks to several images and spyshots that have surfaced on the interweb. Next-generation Mahindra XUV500 will look radically different from the current model which is a welcome development given that the first generation model was launched in 2011.<br> Since then the company has introduced several facelifts to keep the model updated but it's about time the XUV500 comes sporting an all-new design.

Besides new exterior design, the new generation Mahindra XUV500 will also get a new interior layout as the existing one looks quite dull, especially in comparison to rivals like Tata Harrier, MG Hector, and the recently launched Hector Plus. So, the new XUV500 is likely to ditch the existing interior layout for a neatly laid out dashboard. It will get horizontal aircon vents, a bigger touchscreen infotainment system, flat-bottomed steering wheel, new upholstery and new design for the seats. We also expect Mahindra to make use of plush material like soft-touch panels inside the vehicle.</p>
